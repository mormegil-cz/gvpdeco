FILE STRUCTURE
==============

File Header
	- see above for structure
File title
	- Unicode string, zero terminated
	- pointed to by both [Header+16] and [Header+24]
"Voices" table
	- Unicode zero terminated strings, one directly after another
	- beginning at [Header+92]
	- [Header+52] entries
"Tokens" table
	- entry format:
		0	4	Token ID?
		4	?	Unicode zero terminated string - token identifier
	- beginning at [Header+36]
	- [Header+32] bytes total size
"Identifiers" table
	- entry format:
		0	4	Sound ID
		4	?	Unicode zero terminated string - sound identifier
	- beginning at [Header+48]
	- [Header+40] entries
"Categories" table
	- Unicode zero terminated strings, one directly after another
	- beginning at [Header+44]+[Header+48]
	- ending at [Header+64]
"Sounds" index
	- list of 4-Byte integers, every entry: lower 4 bits are variation number, the rest (28 bits) are the sound ID.
	- beginning at [Header+64]
	- [Header+56] entries
"Category index" index
	- list of 4-Byte integers, every entry: absolute offset of the "Categories" table entry into which the sound does classify
	- beginning at [Header+64]+4*[Header+56]
	- [Header+56] entries
"Waves" index
	- entry format:
		0	4	Absolute offset of the phrase for the sound (in the "Phrases" section) (0=does not have a phrase)
		4	4	Absolute offset of the WAVE file containing the sound (in the "Sound data" section) (0=does not have a sound)
	- beginning at [Header+64]+8*[Header+56]
	- [Header+56]*[Header+52] entries
"Phrases" section
	- Unicode zero terminated strings, one directly after another
	- beginning at [Header+72]
	- [Header+68] entries
"Sound data" section
	- RIFF WAVE files, copied one after another so that each has absolute offset divisible by 4
	- beginning at [Header+84]
	- [Header+76] entries
